## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I love creating things and solving problems with code.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently specialising in enterprise WordPress development with the amazing team @ [https://thecode.co/](https://thecode.co/).
- ðŸŒ± I'm always learning, and enjoy dabbling in side projects, configuring my dev environment and building developer tools.
- âš¡ Fun facts: Husband and dad of two, from the land down under ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º. Outside of coding I love playing, writing and listening to music.
